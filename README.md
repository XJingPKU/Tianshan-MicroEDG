**Abstract**  
Elevational gradients and vertical soil profiles serve as natural laboratories for dissecting biodiversity patterns and their drivers. The vertical soil profile, a complex spatial system defined by gradual physicochemical gradients, supports depth-specific microbial communities that drive essential biogeochemical processes, from surface decomposition to subsurface carbon storage and groundwater purification. These processes underpin the ecosystem services vital to human societies. Despite this importance, soil microbial diversity along elevational gradients, particularly its variation with soil depth, remains poorly understood. Along a 60-km elevational transect (465–3035 m) and 0–50 cm depth profiles on the Tianshan Mountains, China, we found that soil microbial diversity exhibited a hump-shaped pattern along elevational gradients, peaking at intermediate elevations. Surface soil fungal diversity was a notable exception. This hump-shaped pattern intensified with increasing soil depth. From surface to subsurface soils, environmental filtering explained an increasing proportion of the variance in microbial diversity: it rose from 60% to 87% for bacterial diversity across the 0–50 cm depth range and from 22% to 50% for fungal diversity within the 0–30 cm depth range. We further demonstrated that environmental filtering factors—primarily plant diversity, abiotic soil properties, and chemical energy availability rather than thermal energy availability—exerted stronger influences on microbial diversity in subsurface soils. Our study reveals soil depth as a critical factor in microbial biogeography; deeper soils experience intensified environmental filtering. Such depth-dependent dynamics suggest that environmental changes may disproportionately affect these deeper microbial communities, potentially disrupting key ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. Consequently, conservation strategies must prioritize vertical stratification to safeguard below-ground biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services. By highlighting soil depth as a pivotal dimension, this study extends our understanding of microbial responses to global change across multidimensional environmental gradients.
